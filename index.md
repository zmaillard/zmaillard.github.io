I am Zach Maillard, a software developer and cartographer living in Boise, Idaho.  I have 14 years of experience working with .NET technologies and the Esri GIS software stack.

My development interests include incorporating spatial data into an application, and working with Open Source software.  Data is great, but displaying that data on a map brings a whole new depth to the information.  I also love the idea of Open Source software and I try to incorporate that into my projects.
