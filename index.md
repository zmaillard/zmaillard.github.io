I am Zach Maillard, a software developer and cartographer living in Boise, Idaho.  I have almost 15 years of expierence working with .NET technologies and the Esri GIS software stack.

My development interests include bringing spatial data into a project.  I also love the idea of Open Source software and try to incoporate that into my projects.
